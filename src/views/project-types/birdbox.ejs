                    <p>
                        This project type is for logging activity at nesting boxes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The survey forms are modelled on NestWatch data. If you are the
                        only person managing your nesting boxes, their app is likely the
                        best solution. However, if you have volunteers submitting data or
                        other stakeholders who need to see your data, this project is designed
                        for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with anything on this site currently, this
                        functionality is in testing.
