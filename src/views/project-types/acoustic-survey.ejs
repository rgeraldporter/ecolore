                        This project type is designed for cases where a project
                        has accumulated a number of audio recordings that
                        require review.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently the requirements are built around the Hamilton
                        Bioacoustic Research Project, which uses archive.org as
                        a host of the audio files, and Audacity as the program
                        for documenting observations. Those documented
                        observations (in the form of "label" text files) can
                        then be bulk uploaded and converted into observations in
                        the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with anything on this site currently, this
                        functionality is in testing.
