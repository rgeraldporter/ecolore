                    <p>This is the first set of release notes included in EcoLore.</p>
                    <p>Here is a brief summary of changes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding a new project type: Acoustic Surveys. More detail will be added about how this works as we
                            progress through an acoustic survey project with the Hamilton Naturalists' Club.</li>
                        <li>Set the release dates to be less ambitious...</li>
                        <li>Data display can now handle data that is not purely string-based, useful for when data was imported
                            from a file rather than via a webform input.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fixed a bug with custom survey validations in turtle watch surveys.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Custom language can now be used for Zones and Cycles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Multiple observations can now be generated from a single survey form, such as from a file upload.
                            This is used in the acoustic surveys.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zone IDs can now be saved in a Survey record in the table column set aside for that purpose, rather than
                            just in the generic data column.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cycles no longer shift dates back a day due to timezone offsetting.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
